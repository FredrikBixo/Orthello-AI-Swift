## How to run it

In order to run the program, you will have to download Xcode. You can download it from [here](https://apps.apple.com/se/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).

After you have installed XCode, you can simply open the project with XCode and run it.

**Note:** XCode is currently only available for mac. In order to run the program on windows, you will either have to run the program using a cloud desktop server, or convert the code to another language. You could for example use [SwiftKotlin](https://github.com/angelolloqui/SwiftKotlin).
